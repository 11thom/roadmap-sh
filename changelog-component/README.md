# Changelog Component

## Goal

In this project you are required to create a simple component for a website that displays a changelog. A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

## Requirements

Feel free to customize the design and layout of the component as you see fit. The focus should be on creating a well-structured and responsive component that can be easily integrated into a website.
